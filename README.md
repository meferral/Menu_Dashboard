## General info
-	The motivation for my capstone in creating a dashboard for  to have real time data for operators on which areas are driving their cost per meal (CPM= how much it costs in food per customer).  
-	Data Question- How can we get NetMenu data to be displayed with visuals and have it updated with Meal Plan reports coming out of Gold daily?
-	Data to be Used- we will use the menu export from NetMenu and the daily swipe reports out of Gold

The real motivation for this lies in operators being able to go to a central spot to get the information they need and allow them to make better decisions moving forward without having to learn how to run reports out of the system OR giving them a better idea of what reports they need to look at.  

KPIâ€™s that will be focused on the dashboard will be CPM and food waste.

How can we look at in real time what our CPM is and what is driving that cost? 

How can we make better decisions about our menu mix that touch on the areas that we deem important (socially responsible menuing) and still keep costs in line?
