Slicer Panel
===================================

-   Date Slicer narrows down all available dates
-   Meal Period Slicer is driven by the Service Course Slicer for which
    Service Courses are selected
-   Service course slicer was purchased from okviz and can be controlled
    with ctrl key
    -   in planning the CPM for the entire dining hall the number of
        customers for that meal period has to be divided by the cost of
        the specific station, and typically guests do not go to all
        atations. With this slicer you can bump up stations that will go
        together
        -   ex. "lets look at Chefs Table, Salad Bar and Bakery...
            through the week- I will leave it here to explain some cards
            and KPI's in a minute"
-   In the table the operators can see how farr off they are from their
    top line numbers for how they have forecasted for the week. The
    "Meal Plan" count comes in when the gold report is updated
-   the card below represents the results of the table and is RED when
    the forecasted Meal Plans are less and GREEN when they are higher

Top Clustered Column Chart and Word Map
=======================================

-   the top clustered column chart is looking at amounts forecasted,
    then prepared, then served. It is all clickable for drill down
    ability
-   one thing to be cognizant of when looking at this is that amounts
    are not always apples to apples- sometimes thing are forecasted by
    the 'each' and other time by the 'pound'
-   The word map helps illustrate this more with the tool tips defining
    the unit of measure that the menu item had

Bottom Clustered Column Chart and Word Map
==========================================

-   this chart is looking at the cost in the same manner that the above
    visual is looking at the amounts
-   these fields were calculated in the cleaning process for this
    analysis to be done
-   Look at the Omelets Station where there top costs are the cheese and
    the spinach, but he most leftover item was the eggs
-   drill down for those reports where the operator can directly use
    this when forecasting their next menu

Both of those charts also show how engaged staff are with the menu
management process. It should be unlikely that the amount produced and
the amount served are the same with no leftovers.

Cards
=====

-   CPM Goal card shows how far off their actual CPM is from their
    forecasted CPM, if they come in over their goal the number is RED
    otherwise it is GREEN
-   the leftover per customer is the amount of leftovers recorded for
    how many customers came through the line, in future iterations of
    this dashboard we would use actual waste tracking data to drive this
    metric
-   Leftovers as a % of prepared is the leftover cost divided by the
    prepared cost
